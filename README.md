# RedBot Cogs
This repository contains Cogs made for RedBot v3.

## Cogs
### Purge
This cog allows you to daily clean up messages in channels you choose.
The daily purge timestamp and channel warning time must be set in the sourcecode.

**Commands:**
 - **!purge** Purges the current channel now.
 - **!purgeadd** Adds this channel to the daily purge.
 - **!purgedailynow** Starts the daily purge routine now for this server.
 - **!purgelist** Lists all channels that are being purged daily on this server.
 - **!purgeremove** Removes this channel from the daily purge.
 - **!purging** Checks if this channel is being purged daily.

### Info Screen
This cog allows you to create an info screen containing a lot of different information.
It is very hard and tedious to use, so I recommend _not using it_.

**Commands:**
 - **!infoadd** Adds an entry.
 - **!infoedit** Edits an entry.
 - **!infolist** Lists entries in the info screen.
 - **!infomove** Moves an entry to a new index.
 - **!inforemove** Removes an entry.
 - **!infosend** Sends the info screen in the current channel.
 - **!infoswap** Swaps an entry with another.
